## 🔧 Fixes Applied During Testing

### 1. JWT Strategy Fix
**Problem:** JWT returned `userId` but controllers expected `sub`
**Solution:** Updated JWT strategy to return `sub`
**Files Modified:**
- `src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts`
- `src/adoption/adoption.controller.ts`

### 2. Search Test Update
**Problem:** Search test didn't include description field
**Solution:** Updated test to expect description in OR clause
**Files Modified:**
- `src/pets/pets.service.spec.ts`
